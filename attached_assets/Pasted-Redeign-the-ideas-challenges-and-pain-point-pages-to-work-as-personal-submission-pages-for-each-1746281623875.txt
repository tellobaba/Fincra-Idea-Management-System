Redeign the /ideas, /challenges, and /pain-point pages to work as personal submission pages for each user. Follow these exact instructions:

IDEAS PAGE (/ideas)

The page should only display the logged-in user's own ideas.

Remove the "Category" field from the submission form.

Change "Organization Category" to "Workstreams".

Make the file upload input fully functional.

Add a voice note input (either a file upload or voice recorder).

All call-to-action buttons for submitting an idea across the app should use this new form.

The existing /ideas page (which shows charts and all ideas in the system) should be moved to the "Ideas" button under the Welcome Back section (main dashboard). That version should still show all ideas and analytics.
CHALLENGES PAGE (/challenges)

The page should only display the logged-in user's own submitted challenges.

All current example or test challenges should be deleted from the database.

Replace the form fields with the following inputs:

Title
Description
Criteria (e.g., "Must be built using Vibe coding")
Timeframe (e.g., "14 days")
Reward (e.g., "$500 and dinner with the CEO")
All call-to-action buttons that trigger new challenge submissions should point to this new form.

Move the existing company-wide challenges dashboard (with charts and lists of all challenges) to the "Challenges" button under the Welcome Back section.

/PAIN-POINT PAGE

The page should only show pain points submitted by the logged-in user.
All dummy or test pain points should be deleted from the database.
Replace the current form with the following fields:
Title
Department Related to Problem (dropdown with: Organisation Health, Technology & Systems, Commercial & Strategy, Process, Cost Leadership, Other)
Description
Urgency (dropdown with: High, Medium, Low)
Root Cause
Upload File
Record Voice Note
Ensure the file upload and voice input are functional.
All call-to-action buttons for submitting a pain point should use this new form.
Move the full company-wide pain point charts and analytics to the "Pain Points" button under the Welcome Back section.
