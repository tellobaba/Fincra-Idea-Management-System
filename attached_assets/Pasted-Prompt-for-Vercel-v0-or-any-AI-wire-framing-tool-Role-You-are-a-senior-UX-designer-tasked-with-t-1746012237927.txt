Prompt for Vercel v0 (or any AI wire-framing tool)

Role:
You are a senior UX designer tasked with translating the PRD for Fincra’s Ideas Management System into low-fidelity wireframes that illustrate the complete user journey.

1. Overall Goals
Deliver a dashboard-first experience, not a marketing website look.


Make the primary Call to Action (CTA) impossible to miss: “Hi Joy, what’s been on your mind?” with three clearly separated buttons


“I’ve got a PAIN-POINT” (Problem)


“I’ve got an IDEA” (Opportunity)


“I want to post a CHALLENGE” (Problem / Opportunity)


Keep navigation intuitive, role-based, and consistent across all pages.



2. Wireframe Set & Flow
Create one frame per bullet (unless noted as a modal). Wireframes can be sketched or greyscale; annotations welcome.

3. Visual & Interaction Guidelines
Dashboard, not Website: Use a compact grid, card components, and data-dense tables—avoid hero images except the greeting CTA block.


Hierarchy: Sidebar nav (primary) → Header (utility) → Main canvas (content) → CTA block (high emphasis).


Roles: Hide Admin Panel link unless role = reviewer | transformer | implementer.


Micro-copy: Friendly and concise; use sentence-case labels.


Accessibility: 4.5:1 contrast for text, focus rings, keyboard-friendly.


Mobile: Single-column layout; sidebar collapses into bottom nav bar.



4. Deliverables
Annotated low-fidelity wireframes (PNG / SVG / Figma pages).


Clickable flow showing: Login → Dashboard → CTA → Submit Idea → Dashboard, plus lateral navigation to Leaderboard, My Submissions, Admin Panel.


Notes layer describing key interactions, states, and responsive behavior.
