I’m building an Ideas Management Web App using Node.js (Express), React, and PostgreSQL. The database is connected and the frontend is mostly functional. I need to extend the app with full feature support for idea, challenge, and pain point submission and visualization.

Here’s what I need you to build:

---

1. **Navigation and Routing**:
   - Make the “Ideas,” “Challenges,” and “Pain Points” buttons in the left sidebar functional.
   - Each should link to a dedicated page: `/ideas`, `/challenges`, `/pain-points`.

---

2. **Individual Pages (Ideas, Challenges, Pain Points)**:
   Each of the three pages should:
   - Display a list of all submissions in that category.
   - Include analytics charts showing:
     - Total submissions
     - Submission trends over time (weekly, line chart)
     - Who submitted them
   - Make each submission clickable to open a full detail view.

---

3. **Submission Enhancements**:
   For all new idea, challenge, or pain point submissions:
   - Add a form with the following fields:
     1. **Detailed Description**
     2. **Impact and Relevance**
     3. **Categorization** (Dropdown with these options):
        - Organisation Health
        - Technology & Systems
        - Commercial & Strategy
        - Process
        - Cost Leadership
        - Other
     4. **Inspiration or Context Behind the Submission**
     5. **Awareness of Similar Solutions**

   Save all these fields properly in PostgreSQL and allow them to be viewed in the detail page.

---

4. **Voting System**:
   - Enable all ideas to be voted on by users (upvote only, no downvotes).
   - Track the number of votes each user makes.
   - Update the “My Votes” number in the left sidebar to reflect how many ideas a user has voted on.
   - Make the “My Votes” button clickable — redirect to a page (`/my-votes`) that shows all ideas the user has voted for.
   - Ensure “Top Voted” section on the Overview page always lists ideas sorted by vote count in real-time.

---

5. **Analytics Enhancements**:
   - Convert the “Ideas Volume” chart on the Overview page into a **LINE chart**.
   - X-axis should represent **weeks** (past 5 weeks minimum).
   - Y-axis should show total new submissions each week (combined: ideas + challenges + pain points).
   - Chart should go up when more submissions are made, down when fewer are made — calculated dynamically.

---

6. **Technical Stack**:
   - Frontend: React + Tailwind CSS
   - Backend: Node.js (Express)
   - Database: PostgreSQL

Important Notes:
- Do not use any fake or placeholder numbers — all stats and data must be fetched from the PostgreSQL database.
- Everything must update in real time based on actual user activity.
- No admin features for now.
